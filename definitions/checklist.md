[x] Submission suitable for Physiome.

  Editor responsibility.

  - In scope.
  - Primary Paper exists and is peer reviewed or under review. If letter, it should refer to a previous Physiome Paper.
  - Author overlap with primary paper.
  - Manuscript readable (proper language, good order, coherent).
  - Manuscript is written using Physiome template.


[x] Manuscript correctly formatted.

  Curator responsible.

  - All figures are before the references (except appendices).
  - All authors correctly formatted, including capitals and initials.
  - All authors have affiliations, and the affiliations correctly formatted.
  - The countries are not abbreviated in the affiliations.
  - Keywords present and make sense.
  - Corresponding author marked with an asterisk and their email supplied.
  - References have the correct format.


[x] Model implementation executable.

  Curator responsible.

  - All files needed to run the model are supplied.
  - SedML or python script for plotting present.
  - Manuscript contains all information needed to run the scripts.
  - Model produces the results presented in the manuscript, both reproduced results and additional predictions.
  - Software, versions, modules, libraries, settings, time steps, algorithms, etc are stated in the manuscript.


[x] Reproducible targets clearly identified.

  Curator responsible.

  - Reproducibility goals stated and overlap with Primary Paper.


[x] Model is reproducible.

  Curator responsible.

  - Model produces the results presented in the manuscript, both reproduced results and additional predictions.


[x] Model modifications clearly explained.

  Curator responsible.

  - Equations supplied for changes in the model from the Primary Paper (if needed).
  - Parameter sources stated.


[x] Appropriate standards used.

  Curator responsible.

  - Model is in standardised format or has a good reason not to be.
  - Annotated if possible.
  - Documentation available, either as comments in the code or described in the paper.
  - Appropriate modularity.


[x] Parameter sources clearly identified.

  Curator responsible.

  - Parameter sources clearly identified. Primary paper is sufficient as a source.


[x] Provenance is clear.

  Curator responsible.

  - Reference back to previous versions of the model. In a way that can be picked up by altmetrics etc.



[x] Overlap between Primary Paper - Manuscript - Code.

  Curator responsible.

  - If all results overlap, check random equations.
  - If something seems fishy, start pulling on that thread. Check the code vs the equations more fully, and/or ask the authors about the discrepancy.


[x] Article fit for publication.

  Editor responsible.

  - Go through the curators evaluation and determine if the required goals for that type of model are fulfilled.
  - Publish after payment.
